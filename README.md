**Getting and Cleaning Data Final Project**

*Instructions*

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

    1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    
    2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    
    3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    
    4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
    
    5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
    
*Steps to work on this course project*

  1) Download the zip file of the data.
  2) Unzip the file.
  3) Move the following text files to the folder that your r script is located in:
     - features.txt
     - subject_train.txt
     - subject_test.txt
     - X_train.txt
     - X_test.txt
     - y_train.txt
     - y_test.txt
     
     
Once those steps are complete, you can run the R file. Make sureyou download the reshape2 package.
The end result of the R script is a tidy data set.
